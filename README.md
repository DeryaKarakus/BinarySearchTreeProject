# BinarySearchTreeProject
I made The Binary Search Tree project to finish the Data Structures and Algorithms path in Patika.dev.

## PROBLEM : [7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2] -> Specifies the stages of Binary-Search-Tree.

1. I choose the 5 for the Root then : 
                   5
              3         7
           1    4     6   8
         0   2              9
